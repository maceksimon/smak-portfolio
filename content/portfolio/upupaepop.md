# Letterpress in WordPress: Print studio portfolio

Building a web for a designer and typographer is an amazing opportunity. Not only you get to implement a beautiful design, you also learn a lot during the process!

My client for this project was Jakub. He is a designer and a typographer and he owns a small printing studio. He wanted to cut down on a maintenance costs of his Wix site and combine his web with an eshop. By utilizing open source software, we managed to reduce the maintenance costs to a minimum and concentrate all the important information in one place.

Jakub created a simple design that fit his needs. He focused on clean presentation with interesting fonts and a few graphic elements, such as the go-to-top hand at the bottom of the page or the zig-zag separator above the menu.

We decided to customize a [Pinecone](https://themeforest.net/item/pinecone-creative-portfolio-and-blog-for-agency/13200056) theme from Theme Forest. By creating a child theme, I was able to apply all the customizations necessary, while preserving the original theme code and preserving my changes if the theme updates.

Another key step was optimizing images. The studio's portfolio is very image-heavy and serving the right image sizes in the right quality is therefore crucial for performance. I integrated the [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) service into the WordPress theme, so that all images loaded into the media gallery get processed, cached and served in the right format and size. This improved the performance greatly, even when viewing a whole set of full-screen images.

Finally, the website was also intended to sell the studio products. I integrated and set up [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) to easily enable the functionality. I customized the shipping and payment options and integrated a payment gateway to allow for card payments. Now the studio receives the orders directly into their mailbox.

By utilizing open source software, pre-made theme and services which offer free plans, we were able to keep the project cost very low while keeping a high standard of quality of the deliverables.

Jakub is fond of his new website and we continue collaborating on other web projects.
