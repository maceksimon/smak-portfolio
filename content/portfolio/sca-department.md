# Learning together: A university department website

In this project, I was asked to update a website of my university department. Milan, a university researcher and lecturer who took care of the web had designed a working version of the WordPress web in [Elementor](https://elementor.com/). However, the site seemed to be lacking in design and readability. There were also requests for additional content types and an English translation.

I first supplied a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) design for example pages. I worked with the current content of the web, as the only thing that would change was the theme. However, in this case, I decided for a custom theme built from scratch, as it would give me full control over the content types and design templates.

I implemented an information board composed of the newest articles and short announcements about the day-to-day issues in the department. I also **provided instructions** to all staff on how to edit the content making them more comfortable with using the site.

By replacing the Elementor components with custom ones, I removed the overhead of the plugin which may make the website load slower. I also gained a fine-grain control over each part of the page so I could more easily make UX improvements such as making the staff images link to the individual profiles. On [lecturer's profile pages](https://kska.upce.cz/okatedre/lide/adam-horalek/), I used a card with tabs to more easily display various types of information. The custom code also allows for greater maintainability as the internal structure is not broken up into multiple plugins.

The response to the new design was great. The theme is ready to be translated into English and I continue to make updates and implement new features in collaboration with Milan and the rest of the staff.
