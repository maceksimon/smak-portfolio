# Watch it grow: Developing a community garden website

This was a lovely community garden project which I supported by volunteering as a web designer. The landing page I created provided a great for people to join the project.

## Garden needs water and...

The website's goal was to bring in people interested in gardening. The landing page enabled the visitors to register as either a volunteer (helping out in the garden) or a gardener (owning a piece of the garden bed to grow their plants in). I created a **database** which stored the information about the registered gardeners and calculated how many free spots were left for people to book.

## Tech for the nature

The website offers three ways of participating. Registering as a volunteer or a gardener, or subscribing to a newsletter. I created a special **form for each action**. The forms are linked to a shared email and to a central database, where the user data is safely stored. I used [Netlify Forms](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) to link the forms to the admin email. This way, the garden team gets a notification about each registration.

I used [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to store the data. This makes it easy to link the database with the forms through the API. It also allows for **scalability** and **efficient data management**. The forms are built with Vue.js. This makes it very easy to implement important features such as **validation and error messages**.

The website was hosted on Netlify - did you know that [static hosting is better for the environment](https://www.netlify.com/sustainability/)?

## Sharing is caring

As the website was to be **shared across social media**, it was especially important to create optimized social sharing tags and [Open Graph images](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/). This adds that extra punch when the web is shared on Facebook or Twitter.

## Animation is bringing things to life

We wanted to communicate a fun and friendly vibe which the garden has in real life. I used open source illustrations and **animated** them with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) library. Little interactive elements make users stay on the page and play around with it. My goal, as always, is to create a digital experience which the users enjoy and spend time with.

## Final thoughts

The garden beds were soon booked for the summer and the website is going to grow together with the community, as we continue to develop new features.
